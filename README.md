# Neha Sabannavar Portfolio

## Profile

My motivation behind creating this simple portfolio page was to showcase my skill set to employers.
It consolidates my work (small github projects) and contact details in a single web page.
While developing this page, I came across many simple animations which CSS provides to make it more user friendly. I tried to use them here.
